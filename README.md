# bookstore_website

In the development of an online bookstore platform, I utilized a full-stack approach by integrating HTML, CSS, and React for the frontend, with Node.js (Typescript) and Java powering the backend.

The website offers a comprehensive product catalog, a dynamic shopping cart, and a secure payment gateway. To enhance the user experience, I implemented persistent storage solutions using MySQL for server-side data retention. This enabled efficient management and retrieval of user shopping cart data across sessions. By leveraging MySQL's relational database capabilities, the website can reliably save customers' shopping cart contents, ensuring a consistent and seamless shopping experience even during return visits.
